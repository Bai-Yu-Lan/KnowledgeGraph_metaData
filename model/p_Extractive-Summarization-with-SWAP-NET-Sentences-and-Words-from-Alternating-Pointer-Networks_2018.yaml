abstract: "We present a new neural sequence-tosequence model for extractive 
summarization called SWAP-NET (Sentences and Words from Alternating Pointer 
Networks). Extractive summaries comprising a salient subset of input sentences, 
often also contain important key words. Guided by this principle, we design 
SWAP-NET that models the interaction of key words and salient sentences using 
a new twolevel pointer network based architecture. SWAP-NET identifies both 
salient sentences and key words in an input document, and then combines them 
to form the extractive summary. Experiments on large scale benchmark corpora 
demonstrate the efficacy of SWAP-NET that outperforms state-of-the-art 
extractive summarizers."
