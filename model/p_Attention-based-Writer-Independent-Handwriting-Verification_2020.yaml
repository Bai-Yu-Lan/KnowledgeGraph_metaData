abstract: "The task of writer verification is to provide a likelihood score 
for whether the queried and known handwritten image samples belong to the 
same writer or not. Such a task calls for the neural network to make 
it's outcome interpretable, i.e. provide a view into the network's decision 
making process. We implement and integrate cross-attention and soft-attention 
mechanisms to capture the highly correlated and salient points in feature 
space of 2D inputs. The attention maps serve as an explanation premise for 
the network's output likelihood score. The attention mechanism also allows 
the network to focus more on relevant areas of the input, thus improving 
the classification performance. Our proposed approach achieves a precision 
of 86% for detecting intra-writer cases in CEDAR cursive 'AND' dataset. 
Furthermore, we generate meaningful explanations for the provided decision 
by extracting attention maps from multiple levels of the network."
