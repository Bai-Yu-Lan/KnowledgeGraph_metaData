description: "SQuAD v2.0 combines existing SQuAD v1.1 data with 
over 50,000 unanswerable questions, which are intentionally written 
in answerable form. So the model must not only answer the questions 
as best they can, but also identify which questions have no supporting 
answers or cannot be answered."
