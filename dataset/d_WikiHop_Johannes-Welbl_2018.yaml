description: "WikiHop is a multi-hop question answering dataset. Queries for 
WikiHop are constructed using entities and relationships in WikiData, and 
the supporting documentation is from WikiReading. First build a bipartite 
graph connecting entities and documents, and find the answer to each 
query by traversing the graph. Contains candidates that are consistent 
with the answer type and have the same relationship to the answer in 
the query, resulting in a set of candidates. The total number of 
samples in the training set is about 43K, the number of samples in 
the development set is about 5K, and the number of samples in the 
test set is about 2.5K. A test set is not provided. The task is to 
predict the correct answer given a query and multiple supporting documents."
