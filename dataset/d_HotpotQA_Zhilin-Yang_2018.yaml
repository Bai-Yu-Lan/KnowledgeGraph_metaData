description: "The dataset contains 113k Wikipedia-based question-answer pairs, 
questions that require searching and reasoning across multiple documents to 
answer, and questions that are diverse in content and not constrained by 
any existing knowledge base or knowledge model. The dataset provides the 
sentence-level facts needed for inference, enabling the QA system to 
reason and interpret predictions under strong supervision, providing 
a novel factor to test the QA system's ability to extract relevant facts 
and make necessary comparisons."
