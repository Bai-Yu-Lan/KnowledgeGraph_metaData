description: "The model first uses weakly supervised multi-instance learning to 
construct a title-guided visual diagram, introducing beneficial inductive bias. 
Then, use adjacent and contextual nodes with text and visual features to 
enhance the representation. During the build process, the model further 
uses multi-task learning to merge visual relationships to jointly 
predict words and object/predicate tag sequences."
