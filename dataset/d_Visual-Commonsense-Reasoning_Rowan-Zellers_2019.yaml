description: "Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a large-scale dataset for 
cognition-level visual understanding. Given a challenging question about an 
image, machines need to present two sub-tasks: answer correctly and provide 
a rationale justifying its answer. The VCR dataset contains over 212K (training), 
26K (validation) and 25K (testing) questions, answers and rationales derived 
from 110K movie scenes."
